#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It involves using structured methodologies, programming languages, and best practices to build reliable, scalable, and efficient software systems. Software engineering is the backbone of modern technology, driving innovation, efficiency, and security in the digital world. It plays a critical role in shaping the future of businesses and society by ensuring software systems are reliable, scalable, and secure.

 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 

1. The 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering ( Birth of the descipline) : this conference formally defined software engineering as a descipline, emphasizing the need for systemic, engineering-like processes to manage complexity and improve reliability.
 
2. The Agile Manifesto (2001) Revolutionazing Development Practices : In 2001, 17 software developers published the Agile Manifesto, prioritizing:
- individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- working software over comprehensive documentation.
- costumer collaboration over contact negotion.
- responding to change over over following plan.

3. Open-Source Software and Collaborative Development (1990s-2000s) : Historically, software was proprietary and siloed. The 1980s saw the free software movement (led by Richard Stallman), but open-source collaboration exploded in the 1990s. For instance, GitHub in 2008 became the hub for open-source collaboration, hosting projects like Python, React, and Kubernetes.

  
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle : The software development life cycle is a structured framework for building high quality software efficently. The following are the core phases in SDLC;

i.  Requirements Gathering and Analysis - this involves defining what the software should achieve.

ii. Software Design - this involves planning on how to build the software.

iii. Implementation (Coding) - this involves transforming the design into working software.

iv. Testing - this involves ensuring that the software meets requirements and is defect-free.

v. Deployment - this involves releasing the software to users.

vi. Maintainance and Support - this involves ensuring that the software has a  long-term usability and that it adapts to changes.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Characteristics of each 
For Waterfall, it is sequential, with each phase depending on the previous one. Documentation is heavy, and changes are hard to make one a phase is completed. Agile is iterative, with sprints or iterations, continous feedback, and adaptability to change. it emphasizes collaboration and costumer involvement.

Comparisons
Waterfall is structured and predictable, which is good when requirements are clear and unlikely to change. Agile is more flexible, which suits projects where requirements are expected to evolve. Waterfall might struggle with changes late in the process, while Agile can accomodate changes more easily.

Constrasts 
Waterfall has a rigid structure; Agile is adaptive. Waterfall requires thorough documentation upfront; Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation. Waterfall is good for projects with fixed scopes and deadlines; Agile is better for projects needing frequent deliverables and adaptability.

Scenarios where each is appropriate
Waterfall could be used in construction projects where the requirements are well-defined, like bulding a bridge. Once the the design is set, changes are costly. Agile would be suitable for software development where client needs might change, like a startup developing a new app where user feedback is crucial.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Starting with the software developer. In a software development team. They are responsible for writing, debuging, and maintain code using progamming languages like., Python, Java, and JavaScript.

Next, Quality Assurance Engineer. Their main job is the software development team is testing the software. Ensuring software quality by identifying defects and validating user requirements. They also create test plans, automate tests, document bugs, and ensure quality standards. 

Project manager. They oversee the project, manage timelines, resources, communication. They coordinate between team members and stakeholders. Their responsibilies in the software development include; planning, risk management, tracking progress, and facilitating meetings like stand-ups or sprint planning. Also, ensuring the project stays within scope, time, and budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs streamline software development by consolidating essential tools into a unified interface, enhancing productivity and reducing errors. Key benefits include, debugging and testing which includes, built-in debuggeres and testing frameworks (e.g., PyTest for Python) that help catch errors early. Examples include: visual studio code (lightweight, extensible IDE with support for Python, JavaScript, and Go via plugins), intelliJ IDEA, pyCharm. 

VCS manages code changes, enabling collaboration and safegurding against data loss. Key benefits include, team collaboration wich enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase via branching and merging. Examples include, Git (GitHub, GitLab), subversion (SVN), and mercurial. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 

Software engineers face several challenges in their work, ranging from technical difficulties to interpersonal and organisational issues. Here are some common challenges and strategies to overcome them:
1. Keeping up with rapidly changing technology
   Challenge: new programing languages, frameworks, and tools emerge constantly, making it hard to stay updated
   Strategies:
   - Dedicate time to continous learning through online courses, blogs, and poadcasts
   - Engage in open-source projects and hackathons
   - Join devveloper communities like stack overflow, GitHub, or reddit.

2. Dealing with complex codebases
   Challenge: legacy code, poor documentation, or highly complex architectures can be difficult to understand and maintain
   Strategies:
   - Follow clean code principles and design patterns
   - Document code properly for future reference
   - Refactor code regularly to improve readability and maintainability

3. Managing deadlines and workload
   Challenges: tight project timelines and multiple responsibilities can lead to burnout.
   Strategies:
   - Use Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) to breake tasks into manageable sprints.
   - Prioritize tasks using frameworks like Elsenhower Matrix or MoSCoW
   - Communicate with stakeholders to set realistic deadlines
     

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing: unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation. It ensures that each unit (such as a function, method, or class) works as expected.
   Importance:
   - Catches errors early in development, reducing debugging costs
   - Ensures that individual components function correctly before integration
   - Facilitates test-driven development (TDD), where tests are written before the actual code

2. Integration testing: integration testing checks how different units or modules work together. It ensures that interactions between components (such as APIs, databases, or third-party services) function correctly
   Importance:
   - Detects communication issues between integrated components
   - Prevents data flow errors, mismatched interfaces, and incorrect API responses
   - Verifies that integrated modules work as expected in a real-world scenario

3. System testing: system testing validates the complete and fully integrated system to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements
   Importance:
   - Tests the system as a whole to enssure all features work together
   - Identifies performance, security, and usability issues
   - Ensure that the system behaves correctly in a production-like environment

4. Acceptance testing: acceptance testing determines whether the system meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. It is often performed by end users or stakeholders
   Importance:
   - Ensures the software meet real-world business needs
   - Verifies that the application works in different environments
   - Reduces the risk of launching a system that does not satisfy user expectations


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing inputs (prompts) to guide AI models, such as ChatGPT, into producing more accurate, relevant, and useful responses. It involves structuring queries effectively to improve the models output and ensure it aligns with the users intent
Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interaction
1. Enhances AI output quality: well crafted prompts help AI generate more precise, coherent, and contextually relevant responses
2. Increases efficiency in AI usage
3. Improves AI customization and control: allows users to shape AI behavior to fit specific needs (e.g., formal vs. casual tone)
4. Enhances AI safety and bias mitigation
5. Supports AI-assited automation


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a vague prompt:
"Tell me about psychology"

Improved prompt
"Explain cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), including its key principles and real-life application in treating anxiety"

Why the improved prompt is more effective 
1. More specific - Instead of a broad topic (psychology), it focuses on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
2. Clear objective - It explicitly asks for key principles and real-life applications, guiding the AI toward a structured response
3. Concise yet detailed - It provides enough detail to shape the answer while remaining direct
4. Better usability - The improved prompt ensures the response is useful for someone interested in CBT and anxiety treatment, rather than receiving a generic overview of psychology
